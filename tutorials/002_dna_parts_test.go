Tiny machines. We are tiny machines"

Almost every public speaking event I do I end up explaining how we are in fact
the gray goo. Most of your body's dry weight is composed of nanobots that
biologists for some reason refer to as proteins despite nanobots being the
perfect description for them.

There are motor proteins that spin and look almost exactly like tiny electric
motors. There are enzymes that are basically tiny chemical reactors. Heck there
are even walker proteins that literally walk around and do stuff.

We are made of tiny machines and the instruction sets for these tiny machines.

In general DNA stores the instruction sets for these tiny machines which is what
we're working with in this tutorial. RNA is used to transport those instructions
to a class of nanobots called ribosomes which then use those instructions to
create, you guessed it, more nanobots. This process is known as the,
"Central Dogma of Biology". Check out this sweet animation to get a better
idea of what's going on.

It turns out that DNA is a really good way to store information and it doesn't
just store information about how to make proteins. Non-protein producing sequences
can regulate gene expression, act as binding sites for other proteins, and
much more.

Here's a short list of the kinds of non-coding elements found in DNA :

Promoters
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(genetics)

Enhancers
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)

Silencers
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silencer_(genetics)

Insulators
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(genetics)

Primer Binding Sites
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)

Ribosome Binding Sites
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome-binding_site

Restriction Enzyme Binding Sites
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme

With the exception of restriction enzyme binding sites these are all
features that you'll often find within the annotated features
of a genome. Often restriction enzyme binding sites are not within
the feature set itself but instead are detectec via regex in most
popular DNA editing tools.

P.S.

Synthetic biologists sometimes refer to these DNA sequences as "DNA parts" and
the organisms they work with as "chassis". These terms aren't commonly used
outside the field and I won't be using them in this tutorial but I wanted to
mention them here so you know what they mean if you see them in the wild.
